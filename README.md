# React_todos

see online: https://todosredux-52071.web.app

Simple React app with FireBase. This project shows the way I develop my applications and sort my files. 
It could be done in a much simpler way, but the aim was to show my skills and structure of my project files.
Also I made 2nd page to show how I use routers
